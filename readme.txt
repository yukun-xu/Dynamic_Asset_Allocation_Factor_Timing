Much time and effort in asset management is spent on “timing”. Broadly speaking this involves shifting exposure to factors (investment, dynamic or macro) in order to generate outperformance relative to a reference portfolio. The classic example is a pension fund using a market timing model to shift equity and bond exposure away from a mix of 60% equities and 40% bonds.

In this project, we choose a reference portfolio and then develop a systematic rebalancing rule for adjusting the reference portfolio exposures through time in an attempt to generate outperformance relative to the benchmark. We evaluate the ability to "time" the exposures to factors that are in the reference portfolio, and also investigate our ability to tactically add exposures to factors that are not in the reference portfolio.
